# Portfolio Page

Version 1.0


# Description

 This application is a personal portfolio page. I chose to go with a very simple layout with muted tones, and focused more on the interactive and funtionality parts of the page. My thought behind this approach comes from knowledge that most devolopers work with graphic and/or user experience designers who are mostly resposible for the artistic style of the application. My job as a developer is to program that wireframe into reality, and make sure the application loads properly.
